# React Blog Site - Navigation Basics

Welcome to the React Blog Site project! In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of navigation and how to navigate between different pages in a React application. As you may already know, React is a Single Page Application (SPA) framework, which means it loads a single HTML file and dynamically updates the page content without requiring multiple HTML files.

## Project Overview

In this tutorial, we will create a multi-page blog site as a web application. The web application will consist of the following main features:

1. **Main View:** This page will display a list of all the blogs available on the site.

2. **Local Data Storage:** Since this is a standalone application, we will store our blog data within the project itself. We will learn how to manage and fetch data locally.

3. **Profile Page:** You will have the opportunity to build your own profile page using React, where you can showcase your information.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this tutorial, you will have gained the following skills and knowledge:

- Build a fully functioning multi-page application using React.
- Manage and fetch data locally within your React application.
- Create a personalized profile page with React, allowing you to showcase your information and skills.
